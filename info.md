# Leopard Light Card 

A high-performance, HomeKit-inspired pill card for your Home Assistant dashboard.

### Why use Leopard Light Card?

Most light cards require you to tap once to open a sub-menu just to change brightness. **Leopard Light Card** turns the entire card into a responsive slider, allowing you to control your lighting with a single swipe.



### Key Features

* **Slide-to-Bright:** Drag anywhere on the card to adjust brightness levels instantly.
* **Smart Icon Toggle:** A dedicated hit-zone on the icon allows for quick On/Off toggling without changing brightness.
* **Haptic UI:** Dynamic background fills and icon colors that match your light's current RGB or Color Temperature state.
* **Optimized Performance:** Built-in debouncing logic ensures that dragging is buttery smooth and won't flood your Home Assistant network.
* **Deep Press Support:** Long-press the card to access the native "More Info" dialog for advanced settings like color pickers or effects.

### Preview

The card is designed to look best in a grid or as part of a sleek, minimalist mobile dashboard. It adapts perfectly to both Dark and Light modes.
